<div class="project-desc">
  <p>When I was working at MicroD, I worked with another engineer to develop a 3D Sectional Builder that allowed customers to design and customize a sectional.</P>

  <p>My main focuses were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Developing a procedural lighting grid to evenly light each part of the sectional</li>
    <li>Enhancing camera controls</li>
    <li>Upgrading the depth of field post processing effect</li>
  </ul>
